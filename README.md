# [Flan's Mod](https://www.flansmod.com/)

This is a fork of the minecraft modification Flan's Mod, reworked by Lithius. 
Any use of first-person pronouns in this document (I, me) will refer to Lithius, not jamieoflan.
Do not post issues encountered with this fork on the original repo, a lot of the core code has or will be changed.

## Installation

If you just want to play with this mod, just head over to [the CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flans-mod-orion-rework) and download the latest release. Make sure you're using Minecraft 1.12.2 and the appropriate Forge version.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues while using Flan's Mod, see this [page](https://github.com/Lithius0/FlansModOrionRework/issues)

## Content Packs

Most content packs designed for pre 6.0 _should_ work just fine without any modifications, but the items might be unbalanced (i.e. guns having too much/too little recoil).
I'll be working on documenting the exact specifications for creating a content pack _soon_.

## Development

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to pitch in and submit a pull request. 

This GitHub environment is to be treated maturely -- do not release any of this source code without prior
permission from jamioflan.
